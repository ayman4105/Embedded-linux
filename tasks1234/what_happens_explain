a- in file tt i write hello and in file cc i write world when use command cat tt | cat cc 
the output is world because the pipe ignore the input 


b- ls | rm ---->rm: missing operand

c- ls /etc/passwd | wc -l ----> 1
because ls tries to list the content of /etc/passwd 
but /etc/passwd is a file, not a directory so 
the output is /etc/passwd
and the pipe send that as input to wc -l 
that wc count the numbers of lines that has one it is /etc/passwd
so output is 1
